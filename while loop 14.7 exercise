1. Using a while loop, create a list numbers that contains the numbers 0 through 35. Your while loop should initialize a counter variable to 0. On each iteration, the loop should append the current value of the counter to the list and the counter should increase by 1. The while loop should stop when the counter is greater than 35.

counter = 0
numbers = []
while counter <= 35:
    numbers.append (counter)
    counter += 1
print (numbers)    

2. Using a while loop, create a list called L that contains the numbers 0 to 10. (i.e.: Your while loop should initialize a counter variable to 0. On each iteration, the loop should append the current value of the counter variable to L and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than 10.)

L = []
counter = 0
while counter <= 10:
    L.append (counter)
    counter += 1
print (L)    

3. Using a while loop, create a list called nums that contains the numbers 0 though 20. (i.e: your while looop should initialize a counter variable on 0. During each iteration, the loop should append the current value of the counter variable to nums and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than 20)

nums = []
counter = 0
while counter <= 20:
    nums.append (counter)
    counter += 1
    print (nums)
    
4. Modify the walking turtle program so that rather than a 90 degree left or right turn the angle of the turn is determined randomly at each step.
